# Visualizing alarms in dashboards<a name="visualize-alarms"></a>

Project owners can add alarms to dashboards to visualize alarm state as data and alarms as thresholds on other properties\.
+ Add a property with an alarm to a visualization to display the alarm as a threshold on that property's data\.
+ Add alarms to [status](choose-visualization-types.md#status-widgets) and [table](choose-visualization-types.md#table-widgets) widgets to display alarm state in a dashboard\.

**Note**  
When you add a property that has an alarm to a visualization, the visualization automatically includes the alarm as a threshold\.
